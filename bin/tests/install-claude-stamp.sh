# bin/tests/install-claude-stamp.sh — HERMETIC unit tests for the serve-plist
# RUNTIME stamps (claude AND codex) written by bin/install.sh (T-ba62) and by
# bin/ocserver install (T-ff48). The filename is historical; the suite covers
# both installers and both runtimes.
#
# THE DEFECT UNDER TEST
# ---------------------
# The release one-click installer wrote a serve plist whose EnvironmentVariables
# carried only HOME / OC_CONFIG / OC_NO_OPEN_BROWSER. The cockpit's 「安裝」
# (POST /api/machines/{id}/bootstrap-here) passes the SERVER PROCESS's env
# straight into `ocwarden install`, so on a one-click host that install ran with
# no PATH and no OC_CLAUDE_BIN and could not resolve a version-manager claude.
# It then installed the warden anyway (WARNING + exit 0), the machine row went
# online, and every spawn afterwards failed with claude_bin_unresolved and zero
# owner-visible signal. bin/ocserver install (the source path) had carried this
# stamp all along — the one-click path, i.e. the path a NEW user walks, was the
# one missing it.
#
# WHY THE SHIM IS SHAPED THIS WAY
# -------------------------------
# Same discipline as install-guard.sh: launchctl/lsof/uname are replaced on PATH
# so nothing in the real launchd domain is read or written, and HOME is
# redirected purely to give the file-side gates a sandbox. What is NEW here is a
# stubbed `claude` on PATH whose `--version` behaviour is selectable, because the
# property under test is exactly "which claude did the installer resolve, and
# under which PATH did it prove it runs".
#
# The assertions read the RENDERED PLIST, not the installer's chatter: a log line
# saying "stamping OC_CLAUDE_BIN" and a plist that actually carries it are two
# different facts, and only the second one reaches the warden.

#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bin/tests/install-preflight-guard.sh — HERMETIC unit tests for bin/install.sh's
# TOOL PREFLIGHT (T-7f38).
#
# THE DEFECT UNDER TEST
# ---------------------
# Every member is a runtime session running inside tmux: `cli/ocwarden/spawn.go`
# builds a codex launch line (:930) or a claude one (:934) and hands EITHER to the
# same `tmuxNewSession` (:950), which fails as `spawn_exec_failed`. tmux therefore
# has no fallback and no runtime exemption. But install.sh never mentioned tmux at
# all: on a machine without it the install went GREEN, the cockpit opened, a hire
# was accepted — and the member then sat at 「waking」 forever while nothing in the
# installer, the server, or the cockpit ever named the cause. The owner's report
# was literally "always waking but no progress, it turns out there is no tmux
# installed".
#
# The RUNTIME half is deliberately weaker than tmux: claude OR codex satisfies it,
# because `ocwarden install`'s own gate (cli/ocwarden/install.go:1057-1061,
# runtime_bin_unresolved) refuses only when NEITHER resolves. A codex-only machine
# is a supported configuration and must install cleanly — case 5b pins that.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE PINS
# --------------------
#   (a) a machine missing a required tool is REFUSED, and refused BEFORE anything
#       is written (no ~/.officraft, no launchd plist);
#   (b) the refusal names the tool AND the command that installs it, and offers
#       NO bypass — a gate with a documented escape hatch is a gate nobody hits;
#   (c) machines that are FINE install exactly as before — both the claude-shaped
#       one and the codex-only one. This is the sentinel every fail-closed gate
#       needs: "refuses when it should" is worthless without "does not refuse when
#       it should not";
#   (d) THE COUNTERFACTUAL: the same missing-tool run against a MUTANT install.sh
#       with the `oc_preflight` call sites deleted must SUCCEED. That mutant is
#       the pre-fix installer, so this case simultaneously reproduces the
#       original defect and proves case (a) is testing the check rather than
#       passing for some unrelated reason.
#
# WHY THE SHIM IS SHAPED THIS WAY
# -------------------------------
# Same discipline as install-guard.sh / install-claude-stamp.sh: uname, launchctl
# and lsof are replaced on PATH so nothing in the real launchd domain is read or
# written, HOME is redirected into a temp dir, and the package binaries are
# stubs. tmux and claude are stubbed too and NEVER invoked — the preflight only
# asks whether they resolve, so a stub is a faithful stand-in, and using the real
# ones would make the result depend on what the CI host happens to have.
#
# One honest limit: the runtime half of the preflight mirrors ocwarden's own
# resolution order, which ends in ABSOLUTE paths (/opt/homebrew/bin, /usr/local/bin
# for both claude and codex) that no PATH shim can hide. On a host carrying any of
# them, "no runtime anywhere" is not constructible and those cases SKIP rather than
# pretend. The tmux cases have no such hole (bare name, PATH only), which is why
# the counterfactual is built on tmux.

# bin/tests/main-red-notify-guard.sh — the notify-on-red job in
# .github/workflows/ci.yml is an ENUMERATION, and this is what stops the
# enumeration from going stale in silence.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (T-5d3b)
# The workflow's notify job depends on `needs: [<every other job>]`. GitHub has
# no wildcard for "all jobs", so adding ANOTHER job and forgetting this line
# does not fail anything: the new job's red simply stops being reported, and the
# workflow stays green-looking in exactly the way this feature exists to prevent.
# A comment asking people to remember is not a mechanism. This is.
#
# EVERY other job means every one, including a job that is not a gate: T-9fe3's
# auto-beta publishes the release the station actually runs, so a failure there is
# "merged" and "reachable" drifting apart — the very silence auto-beta was added
# to end. The edge only goes this way; auto-beta must NOT need this job, or the
# two would form a `needs` cycle and GitHub would schedule zero jobs. That half is
# bin/tests/auto-beta-guard.sh's to enforce, not this file's.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS
#   0. the workflow file PARSES as YAML, under ONE named parser. Not a
#      formality: this ticket shipped a ci.yml whose `run:` block scalar was
#      ended early by a continuation line at column 1. Every local gate and
#      every guard here passed it, because nothing local had ever parsed the
#      file; GitHub answered with a startup failure in which zero jobs ran and
#      the pull request carried zero checks.
#      ⚠️ WHAT THIS PROVES, EXACTLY: that one YAML parser can read the file.
#      GitHub's workflow parser is neither psych nor PyYAML, so a pass here is
#      NECESSARY, NOT SUFFICIENT — it catches the class of breakage that
#      shipped; it does not promise GitHub will accept the file.
#   1. the notify job exists, exactly once
#   2. its gate is `failure() && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`
#      — widened to always() it would message every pull request; widened by
#        dropping the ref test it would message every working branch.
#      An outer `${{ }}` wrapper is normalised away first (both spellings are
#      legal GitHub); everything inside is compared verbatim.
#   3. every OTHER job declared in the file appears in its `needs:` list
#   4. the webhook is reached through a repository secret, and this file carries
#      no URL literal outside comments (the URL is the credential: the inlet
#      authenticates on a token inside it, so a literal here is a public one)
#
#   ⚠️ HONESTY ABOUT 4's SECOND HALF. "no URL literal" was ALREADY TRUE before
#   this ticket — the parent commit's ci.yml has no `://` outside comments. It
#   is a PRESERVING invariant (a regression fence for the future), not a
#   property T-5d3b established. Assertions 1, 3 and the first half of 4 are the
#   ones that were false before the change and are true after it.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT ASSERT — read this before trusting a green
#   It never sends anything and never talks to GitHub. It cannot tell you that
#   the secret is set on the repository, that the endpoint is alive, or that a
#   message arrived: the inlet answers an identical silent 200 to every request
#   INCLUDING one with a bad token, so TOKEN VALIDITY IS ONLY OBSERVABLE AT THE
#   RECEIVING END. This guard covers the shipped CONDITION; the delivery half is
#   verified by actually receiving a message, and that evidence lives on the
#   ticket, not here.
#
#   The job-name scan is line-shaped (two-space keys under `jobs:`) rather than
#   a walk of the parsed document. That would be a silent hole — a job written
#   in a shape the scan does not know would simply not be counted — so the scan
#   is paired with a DELIBERATELY LOOSE second pass: every two-space-indented,
#   non-comment line in the jobs region must be parseable by the strict pattern.
#   One line that the loose pass sees and the strict pass cannot read is a FAIL,
#   not a shrug. The guard is allowed to not understand a line; it is not
#   allowed to not understand it QUIETLY and still claim coverage.
#   ⚠️ That pass says NO LINE WAS SKIPPED IN SILENCE. It does NOT say every line
#   it read is a real job — a two-space key is only a job id because the region
#   is bounded to the `jobs:` block (below), not because the scan can tell.
#
# 🔴 THIS FILE MUST PARSE UNDER APPLE'S BASH 3.2, NOT JUST YOURS.
# bin/tests/run.sh dispatches guards with `bash <file>`, which on a developer's
# Mac is usually a homebrew bash 5.x on PATH — but on the macos-host-gates runner
# it is /bin/bash 3.2.57. That difference is invisible to a local green run.
# It has already bitten this file once: an awk program embedded as $(cat <<'AWK'
# ...) contained a literal apostrophe inside a character class, and bash 3.2's
# parser — which mishandles quotes inside a heredoc nested in a command
# substitution — died with "unexpected EOF while looking for matching ')'".
# Locally: rc=0. On the runner: the whole guard aborted and macos-host-gates went
# red. Apostrophes in the awk source are therefore written \047, and any change
# here must be re-run with an EXPLICIT `/bin/bash bin/tests/main-red-notify-guard.sh`
# before it is believed. Do not use bash-4-only syntax (${var,,}, declare -A, &>>).

# ── 0. the file parses as YAML ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# ONE parser, named, with NO fallback. An earlier cut tried python3+PyYAML and
# fell back to ruby+psych, and the two DISAGREE on real files: an unknown tag
# (`runs-on: !Weird ubuntu-latest`) is a hard error to PyYAML and a clean parse
# to psych; a `%YAML 1.2` directive is the reverse. Same file, same guard,
# rc flipped between 1 and 0 depending on which interpreter the host happened to
# have. A second parser is a second opinion, and a gate whose verdict depends on
# what is installed is not a gate.
#
# ruby is the one that is always there. This guard's ONLY execution surface is
# macOS — bin/tests/run.sh is reached through bin/ci.sh locally and through
# macos-host-gates in the cloud; the ubuntu cloud-gates lane does not run
# bin/tests at all. macOS ships ruby; the macOS runner ships ruby and does NOT
# have PyYAML. Missing ruby is a FAIL with instructions, never a skip and never
# a quiet downgrade to some other parser: "no parser" must not look like "file
# is fine", and neither must "a different parser".
#
# unsafe_load is deliberate: safe_load rejects aliases and anchors, which are
# legal in a workflow file. The method is CHOSEN by respond_to? rather than by
# rescuing NoMethodError (Ruby 2.6's psych has no unsafe_load_file) — a rescue
# would attach that NoMethodError to any later syntax error as its `cause`, and
# print a backtrace that reads like a broken guard instead of a broken workflow.
#
# Exactly ONE document is required. psych reads a multi-document file by
# silently taking the first one, which would let a second `---` document below
# carry jobs that parse clean here and are invisible to everything downstream —
# and GitHub reads a workflow as a single document in any case.
#
# ⚠️ The ruby source below is ASCII-only ON PURPOSE. `ruby -e` takes its source
# as US-ASCII on the system ruby (2.6), so one em dash in a message here is not
# a typo, it is `invalid multibyte char` — the guard then reports the WORKFLOW
# as unparseable when the workflow is fine. Keep messages plain ASCII.

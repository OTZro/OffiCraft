# Proves the `ps` output fields the warden's cutover-effect probe asks for
# ACTUALLY EXIST on this host, and that their output parses.
#
# ── the bug this guard exists to stop from coming back (T-1ac8) ───────────────
# cli/ocwarden/cutovereffect.go read a process's age with `ps -p <pid> -o
# etimes=`. `etimes` (seconds) is a GNU/procps extension. BSD ps — macOS, the
# ONLY platform this warden runs on, because the anchor identity question is a
# TCC question — does not have it:
#
#     $ ps -p 1 -o etimes=
#     ps: etimes: keyword not found        # rc=1
#
# The probe therefore could not read ANY age on ANY machine in the fleet. Every
# verdict folded to `unproven` forever: the three-valued light the whole feature
# exists to provide had exactly one reachable value, and the red state — a
# machine whose cutover has NOT taken effect, the incident this all answers to —
# could never appear.
#
# 🔴 WHY A UNIT TEST CANNOT REPLACE THIS. The Go suite reaches `ps` through a
# seam, and the fake was keyed on the same wrong argv the production code used.
# So the fake answered the broken flag politely, the suite went green, and the
# green ACTIVELY ENDORSED the defect. Three separate readings of that code —
# author, independent reviewer, ticket owner — all missed it, because all three
# were reading rather than running. The only evidence that discriminates here is
# executing the real binary on a real host.
#
# This guard is HOST-SHAPED on purpose: it asserts a property of the machine CI
# runs on, not of the source. That is the point. The repo's land authority is
# the local `bin/ci.sh` run on a fleet machine, so a host-shaped assertion about
# a fleet machine is exactly as authoritative as the rest of the gate.
#
# ── WHAT IT DOES *NOT* COVER ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
#  1. It proves the fields exist HERE. A fleet machine on a different OS
#     revision is only covered when CI runs there.
#  2. The flags are extracted from the Go source, so an argv assembled
#     dynamically would be invisible to it (same static-matching limit as
#     bin/tests/go-test-nocache-guard.sh). The companion Go test pins the argv
#     string itself, which is the half this cannot see.
#  3. It says nothing about whether the VERDICT built from these readings is
#     right — that is the judge's truth table.

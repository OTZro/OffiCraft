#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bin/tests/uninstall-guard.sh — HERMETIC unit tests for bin/install.sh's
# `--uninstall` / `--purge` / `--dry-run` removal path (T-3ef9).
#
# THE CAPABILITY UNDER TEST
# -------------------------
# `--uninstall` is a NEW destructive capability: it stops a launchd job and
# moves (or, with --purge, deletes) files under $HOME/.officraft. Getting its
# ownership check wrong is a strictly worse failure mode than the live-service
# gate in install-guard.sh (that one blocks an install; this one can destroy
# data), so every assertion here has a matching NEGATIVE case: something the
# guard must refuse to touch, with the refusal message asserted, not just the
# exit code.
#
# WHY THE SHIM IS SHAPED THIS WAY (same reasoning as install-guard.sh)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# HOME is redirected to a temp dir for every case (so $ROOT_DIR/$PLIST resolve
# into the sandbox), but the safety net is NOT "we used a temp HOME" — it is
# that OC_LAUNCHD_LABEL is ALSO always set to a per-suite test label, so even
# if the ownership check had a bug, the worst it could do is bootout/register
# a fake label under `launchctl`, which is itself stubbed here and never talks
# to the real launchd domain. `plutil` is deliberately NOT stubbed — like
# install-guard.sh, it only ever reads a plist this suite wrote inside its own
# temp dir, so the real tool gives a more faithful test at zero risk.

"""Minimal black-box SSE client for the conformance suite (stdlib only).

Opens ``GET /api/events`` against ``OC_TARGET_URL`` and parses the raw SSE wire
into event dicts on a background thread, pushing them onto a queue the test
consumes with SHORT bounded waits. Design goals:

  * pure HTTP — no server-implementation imports (black-box iron rule);
  * bounded time — every wait is an explicit ``timeout`` (default 5 s); the
    suite never blocks on the 15 s heartbeat cadence because tests always
    TRIGGER the event they wait for (a write fans the delta within ms);
  * raw fidelity — the parser keeps the ``id:`` line / comment / ``data:``
    fields separate so tests can assert frame SHAPE (e.g. "directed band frames
    carry no id line"), not just payload content.

Parsed event dict:  {"comment": str|None, "id": str|None, "data": str|None}
(one SSE event = the lines up to a blank line; multiple data lines are joined
with "\n" per the SSE spec, though the server never emits multi-line data).

        UNTIL the stream has been silent for ``quiet_for`` seconds, so that no
        frame produced before this point is still reachable by a later
        ``wait_for*`` call. Returns how many data events were swallowed.

        Why this exists (do not replace it with "just move the setup writes"):
        ``wait_for``/``wait_for_frame`` drain FROM THE FRONT of the queue and
        discard non-matching events, so they happily return a frame that was
        already sitting on the connection BEFORE the caller triggered anything.
        A test that opens its connection first and then does any roster/entity
        write during setup therefore hands its first ``wait_for_frame(topic)``
        a STALE frame, and that assertion becomes vacuously true — the publish
        seam it means to guard can be deleted outright and the row stays green
        (observed and reproduced: test_every_closed_topic_emits' ``member``
        row).

        ⚠️ THE LESSON THE FIRST VERSION PAID FOR — read this before "tightening"
        anything here. v1 drained once and then ASSERTED the stream was silent
        for ``quiet_for``; it turned the untouched baseline RED. The frames from
        the setup writes had not arrived yet at drain time (the fan rides a
        0.25 s poll, the drain ran a few ms after the write), so the sweep saw
        an EMPTY queue and the frames landed inside the assertion window.
        **A legitimate setup write's frame is SUPPOSED to arrive late; arriving
        late is not the error — not being swallowed is the error.** v1 confused
        "ASSERT it is quiet now" with "WAIT UNTIL it is quiet", and so it
        classified the normal case as a failure. Hence the loop below: every
        delta seen RESETS the quiet window instead of failing it. Only the outer
        ``timeout`` — meaning "this stream never went quiet at all", i.e.
        something is publishing continuously — is a red.

        The barrier is COUNT-INDEPENDENT by construction, which is the whole
        point: it swallows however many frames appear (0, 2 or 20) and returns
        only after a full silent window, so a future setup write added above it
        cannot silently re-poison the waits below. That is a property, not the
        convention "remember to keep setup to two writes".

        ⚠️ WHAT THIS CANNOT DO (do not design an experiment around it): ANY
        absorbing barrier is necessarily blind to writes that happen AFTER it
        returns. A setup write inserted BELOW this call and above the waits it
        protects will not be caught here, and the row it poisons will go GREEN —
        the vacuous kind of green. Do not "test" that case and read the green as
        reassurance; it carries no information. The guard for that direction is
        binding each observed frame to the VALUE the row's own write just set
        (see the ``member`` row of test_every_closed_topic_emits), because the
        payload is an eager snapshot taken inside hub.Publish and a frame
        published earlier cannot carry a value written later. NOT the subject:
        the polluting frame is usually about the SAME entity, so binding to the
        subject id proves nothing (measured — see that row's own note).

        ⚠️ KNOWN FALSE-RED WAVEFORM (measured with a fake queue, no server —
        review round 2). The budget is deliberate, not a bug, but know where to
        look when a red appears here on a loaded machine:

            silent stream                                  -> returns  ~1.13 s
            a delta every 0.5 s, forever                   -> RAISES   ~5.06 s
            noisy until t=4.6 s, then completely silent    -> RAISES   ~5.01 s

        The third one is the trap: the stream HAD settled, but not early enough
        to fit a full 1 s quiet window inside the 5 s budget, so this raises even
        though nothing is wrong except timing. Baseline lands at ~1.13 s, i.e.
        about 4 s of headroom, so this is a slow-CI / heavily-loaded-box failure
        mode. If you see it, look at what is delaying the fan poll — do NOT just
        widen the budget, which is how a real "something publishes forever" bug
        would get hidden.

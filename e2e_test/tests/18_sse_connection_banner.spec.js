// T-b0bb · a DEAD delta downlink must be visible, and must heal itself.
//
// WHY THIS SPEC EXISTS AND A UNIT TEST IS NOT ENOUGH
// The unit guards (frontend/src/api/http.sse-recover.test.ts) drive a FAKE
// EventSource: they prove the state machine is right, and they prove it against
// an object this repo wrote. What they cannot exercise is the whole stack the
// owner actually looks at — real Chromium, a real non-200 on `/api/events`, the
// real SPA — and it is that stack, not the state machine, that the report was
// about.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT THIS SPEC DOES NOT PROVE, said plainly. It does NOT prove the premise
// underneath the fix — that Chromium never retries a permanently-failed
// EventSource on its own. Proving a negative about the browser needs an
// observation window with our own retry disabled, which this spec does not set
// up. What it proves is the positive half: with the fix in, recovery runs (the
// probe `fetch` below is a fingerprint only this code path leaves), the outage
// is on screen while it lasts, and the page heals without a reload. If the
// premise were false the fix would be redundant, not wrong.
//
// The bug in one sentence: the cockpit is entirely delta-driven, so a downlink
// that has died renders EXACTLY like an office where nothing is happening —
// the owner's own report was that he could not tell, and reached for F5
// (2026-08-21: 「有時候…要 refresh page 才會更新」).
//
// Both halves are asserted, and the second is the one that matters most:
//   1. while the stream is dead, the page SAYS SO;
//   2. when the server comes back, the page reconnects on its own AND the bar
//      goes away — no reload. A recovery that stayed silent would have traded a
//      stall the owner can see for a hole he cannot.
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');
const { ownerToken, bootAuthedSpa } = require('../lib/fixtures');

// The bar deliberately waits out short blips before speaking (see
// CONNECTION_BANNER_GRACE_MS). These timeouts must clear that window plus the
// reconnect backoff, so they are generous on purpose: a tight bound here would
// buy nothing and cost an intermittent red.

    // Requests to /api/events arrive in two kinds and the difference is the
    // evidence, so the way we tell them apart has to be a PROPERTY OF THE
    // REQUEST, not a guess about it:
    //   `X-OC-SSE-Probe: 1` — OUR auth probe. It is a `fetch`, and a fetch can
    //                         set a header; an EventSource structurally cannot.
    //                         The header therefore cannot appear on a real
    //                         stream even in principle.
    //   no such header      — a real EventSource stream attempt.
    // This used to key off Playwright's `resourceType` classification, which is
    // the browser's opinion about the request rather than something the request
    // carries — a rename upstream would have reddened this spec while the

// T-b0bb — the WIRING of ConnectionBanner into the App tree.
//
// 🔴 WHY A WHOLE FILE FOR ONE LINE OF JSX. Review round 4 deleted
// `<ConnectionBanner />` from App.tsx and ran the entire frontend suite: 2475
// tests, all green. Only `tsc` complained, and only with TS6133 (unused
// import) — deleting the import too made even that go quiet. So half of what
// this ticket is FOR (「斷線這件事要看得見」) could be removed by a plausible
// tidy-up and nothing but the e2e would notice.
//
// That gap is a specific shape worth naming: ConnectionBanner.test.tsx pins
// what the component DOES, api/http.sse-recover.test.ts pins what the
// transport PUBLISHES, and between them sits an unguarded assumption that the
// two are connected to each other. A component nobody renders is a component
// that does nothing, however well it is tested in isolation. Unit tests that
// stop at the component boundary leave exactly this seam, and the e2e is too
// expensive and too far away to be the only thing standing on it.
//
// WHAT IS ASSERTED, AND WHY IT IS THE MINIMUM:
//   1. App renders ConnectionBanner AT ALL. That is the mutant above.
//   2. It sits ABOVE the tab strip. The position is a requirement, not taste —
//      the stall is app-wide, so the admission has to be on screen whichever
//      tab the owner is on rather than inside one page's body.
// Nothing here re-tests the banner's own behaviour; that is its file's job.
//
// MEASURED MUTANT (re-runnable by hand against App.tsx):
//   delete the `<ConnectionBanner />` element (and its now-unused import)
//     → reddens both tests in this file.

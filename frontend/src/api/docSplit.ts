// api/docSplit.ts — the frontend's ONE copy of the server's document marker.
//
// ⚠️ THE AUTHORITY FOR THIS RULE IS THE SERVER, NOT THIS FILE.
// `docBodyMarker` / `DocSplitHeadBody` / `DocJoinHeadBody` in
// server/ocserverd/doc_split.go decide where a boot-context document divides.
//
// 🔴 THE REAL COCKPIT NEVER CALLS THIS, AND THAT IS THE POINT (T-3201). The
// wire hands the two halves over already split (`read_only_head` / `body`) and
// takes only the body back, so `http.ts` has no reason to know that a marker
// exists. The one caller is the MOCK ADAPTER, which is standing in for the
// server and therefore has to do what the server does — the same reason
// docCap.ts exists. A second caller appearing in `src/components` or in
// `http.ts` would mean the cockpit had started composing the document itself,
// which is the thing the body-only wire removed.
//
// Mirrored, not invented: a marker that drifted from the server's would make
// the mock split a real seed in the wrong place, which reads as the demo mode
// showing an owner a read-only half that is not the one he would be refused on.

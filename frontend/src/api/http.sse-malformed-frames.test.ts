// The delta downlink must survive ANYTHING the wire hands it.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AS ITS OWN SUITE. `es.onmessage` is a defensive path: it
// is fed by a network socket, it runs outside any React boundary, and this app
// installs no window.onerror / "error" / "unhandledrejection" listener and no
// ErrorBoundary (measured — nothing collects what escapes here). A throw out of
// this handler is therefore both invisible and unrecoverable, which makes "no
// frame may escape" a property worth pinning by enumeration rather than by
// reasoning about it case by case.
//
// 🔴 IT IS ALSO A REGRESSION THIS BRANCH SHIPPED AND THEN HAD TO FIX. An earlier
// commit split one over-broad try/catch into a parse-guard plus an isolated
// fan-out. The split fixed a real defect (a subscriber's throw was being
// mislabelled in the log as a malformed frame) but narrowed the protection at
// the same time: the property access moved OUTSIDE the try, where the old catch
// had silently been covering it. `JSON.parse("null")` does not throw — it
// returns `null` — so a bare `null` frame started throwing a TypeError straight
// out of `onmessage`. Found by an independent reviewer's parity probe run
// against both commits, not by any test here, because before this file the
// entire tree had exactly ONE malformed-frame assertion (`": keepalive"`, in
// http.sse-pool.test.ts). One example is not a guard for a defensive path.
//
// The table below is the enumeration that example was standing in for. `null` is
// the interesting member and the reason for the whole file: every other shape is
// inert only by accident of JS semantics (reading `.topic` off a number, string,
// boolean or array yields `undefined` rather than throwing), while `null` is the
// one value that is neither a parse error nor something you may read a property
// from.

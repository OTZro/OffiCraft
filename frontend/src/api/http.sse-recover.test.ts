// Pins the recovery of the shared SSE downlink from a PERMANENT failure —
// the case the browser explicitly does NOT handle, and the one nothing in this
// app could see.
//
// The shape of the bug this file exists to keep dead:
//   `EventSource` retries by itself only while it can. On a non-200 response, a
//   401, or a wrong `Content-Type` the spec has it FAIL the connection and move
//   it to CLOSED — permanently, no retry, ever. The old code had no `onerror`
//   at all, so `sseSource` stayed non-null pointing at that corpse; every later
//   `ensureSseSource()` early-returned on it, `onopen` never fired again, and
//   the reconnect resync never ran. The cockpit froze, in silence, until a
//   manual reload. Owner's report (2026-08-21): 「有時候…要 refresh page 才會更
//   新」.
//
// Two things are therefore asserted TOGETHER throughout, and neither is
// sufficient alone:
//   (1) it comes BACK — a new connection is built; and
//   (2) coming back REFETCHES — the rebuilt connection's first open fans the
//       full resync, because the stream has no replay (spec/sse.md §2.1) and
//       everything emitted during the outage is otherwise lost forever.
// A "fix" that satisfies (1) without (2) is strictly worse than the bug: it
// replaces a visible stall with an invisible hole.

// MEASURED MUTANTS — every guard below was made to fail on purpose, and each one
// is re-runnable by hand: apply the edit to api/http.ts, run this file, put it
// back. Re-measured 2026-08-27 after independent review round 3; 21 caught,
// plus 2 equivalent mutants documented below rather than falsely pinned.
//
// 🔴 CORRECTION, LEFT IN ON PURPOSE. An earlier version of this header claimed
// these were "single-assertion attributions, not cascades". THAT WAS FALSE and
// review round 1 measured it. The reds are honest — each test independently
// needs the path being broken, so the fan-out is SEMANTIC, not test pollution —
// but "each mutant maps to one named assertion" was not true, and a wrong
// description of evidence is worse than none: it tells the next person there is
// nothing left to check. The `reds` column is the claim now, not an adjective.
//
//   #    the edit                                              reds  the assertion that names it

// ⚠️ TWO MUTANTS DELIBERATELY LEFT UNCAUGHT, because they are EQUIVALENT and a
// test for them would be a lie. R3/R4 revert "mechanism before broadcast" at two
// call sites (schedule-then-announce, teardown-then-announce). Measured 2×2 with
// R2: the ordering only changes behaviour when the isolation is ALSO gone
// (isolation off + announce-first = permanently frozen; every other combination
// recovers). While the isolation stands, no observation can separate them. They
// are kept as a second line and documented at the call site rather than pinned
// by an assertion that would pass either way — writing that assertion is exactly
// the mistake this file has already made twice.
//
// PROVENANCE, because it says something about where the holes were:
//   round 1 review → M2b was a REAL DEFECT in the shipped code (not a
//     hypothetical); M10/M11/M12 were mutants that SURVIVED it.
//   round 3 review → R1 was a REGRESSION THIS BRANCH SHIPPED: splitting an
//     over-broad try/catch narrowed the protection and a `null` frame began
//     throwing out of onmessage. R2 was a pre-existing hole in the THIRD
//     fan-out, upstream of the retry scheduler — its failure mode is this
//     ticket's original bug reached through another door. R5 (the immediate
//     `cb(sseState)`) was found by probing behaviour, NOT by the review's
//     enumeration: that search was `for (const cb of`, and this hand-off is a
//     bare call, so it was invisible to the pattern. A denominator is only as
//     honest as the pattern that produced it.
//   round 2 review → N1 was a REAL DEFECT (P3, found on the head); N3 and N6
//     were mutants that survived, and both survived for the SAME reason: the
//     test named the property but never reached the line. N3's test added a
//     subscriber to a healthy stream, so no second connection ever opened. N6's
//     test advanced time BY THE CONSTANT IT WAS CHECKING — a tautology about
//     that number, green at any value.
//   M12 needed its assertion strengthened before it would die: the difference
//     was entirely OUTSIDE this module (whether oc-auth-expired reaches the auth
//     layer), so a test that only watched this module's own state was blind.
// 🔑 The recurring lesson across all four: an assertion has to be reached, and
// it has to be anchored to something it does not itself define.

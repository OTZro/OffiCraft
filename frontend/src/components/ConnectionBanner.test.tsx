// T-b0bb — the bar that makes a dead downlink VISIBLE.
//
// The whole point of the component is negative space: it must be absent when
// the stream is healthy, absent while a routine blip is being retried, and
// PRESENT once the page has genuinely stopped receiving. A banner that is
// always there is as useless as one that is never there, so both halves are
// asserted here — and the "still absent during the grace window" case is the
// one that keeps a well-meaning simplification (drop the delay, show it
// instantly) from turning the bar into wallpaper.
//
// Real ConnectionBanner + real i18n; only the api seam is faked, so the
// component is driven through exactly the `subscribeConnection` contract the
// transport implements.

// MEASURED MUTANTS (re-runnable by hand against ConnectionBanner.tsx):
//   replace the grace `setTimeout` with a bare `setShowing(true)`
//     → reddens "stays silent through a SHORT drop"
//   delete the `setShowing(false)` in the non-"connecting" arm
//     → reddens "clears the moment the stream comes back"
//   swallow the effect's cleanup — `useEffect(() => api.subscribeConnection(
//     setState), [])` → `useEffect(() => { api.subscribeConnection(setState); },
//     [])` → reddens "unsubscribes on unmount" (added round 4; see below)

// 🔴 WHY THE FAKE COUNTS INSTEAD OF REMEMBERING. The first version of this
// seam stored the callback in a single slot (`push = cb`) and cleared it on
// unsubscribe. That shape is STRUCTURALLY BLIND to the bug it was standing in
// front of: a second mount overwrites the slot, so a leaked subscriber and a
// clean one look identical, and dropping the effect's cleanup entirely left
// the whole tree green (measured, review round 4). React returns the cleanup
// from `useEffect` only if the effect RETURNS it — a stray pair of braces
// silently discards it — so every mount would leak a live subscriber and, in a
// StrictMode/remount world, call `setState` on an unmounted component forever.
// A test can only see that if the fake keeps a SET and the test asserts its
// SIZE; "did somebody unsubscribe" is a counting question, not a memory one.

/**
 * ConnectionBanner — the cockpit saying out loud that it is no longer live.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. Every other view in this app is delta-driven: the
 * roster, the badges, the thread, the reply cards all sit still until the SSE
 * downlink hands them a reason to move. That makes a DEAD downlink and a QUIET
 * office pixel-for-pixel identical. The owner's report (2026-08-21, relayed
 * verbatim on this ticket) is exactly that shape — 「有時候…要 refresh page 才會
 * 更新」: he could not tell that the page had stopped receiving, only that it
 * had stopped changing, and the only tool he had was F5.
 *
 * So reconnecting silently would NOT have been a fix. It would have swapped a
 * stall the owner can see for one he cannot: a page that quietly drops the
 * stream, quietly rebuilds it, and shows nothing either way still leaves him
 * unable to trust what is on screen. The transport half of the fix (api/http.ts)
 * therefore always ends a recovery in the full `resyncAll`, and this half puts
 * the down period on screen while it lasts.
 *
 * WHAT IT RENDERS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT:
 *   "live"          → nothing. A healthy stream needs no chrome.
 *   "idle"          → nothing. Nobody is subscribed (logged out) — not a fault.
 *   "unauthorized"  → nothing. The session is dead and AuthGate is already
 *                     dropping the whole app to the login wall; a banner on top
 *                     of a login screen says nothing the login screen does not.
 *   "connecting"    → the bar, but only after GRACE_MS (below).
 */

/**
 * How long the downlink must stay down before the bar appears.
 *
 * NOT cosmetic damping. The browser's own EventSource retry recovers a routine
 * blip in well under a second, and the state legitimately dips to "connecting"
 * on every one of them (plus once on the very first connect, before the first
 * open). A bar that strobes on each of those is a bar the owner learns to look
 * past — which would cost us the exact thing this component is for.
 *
 * The ceiling on this number is set from the other side: it must stay far below
 * the time a person needs to conclude "nothing is happening" on their own. A
 * few seconds of silence reads as normal; that is the window we are allowed to
 * spend, and no more.

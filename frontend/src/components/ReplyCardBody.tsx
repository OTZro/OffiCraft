// ReplyCardBody — the SHARED interior of a reply card (等我回覆卡), extracted
// from RepliesPage for B3 so the two render surfaces can never drift:
//
//   • RepliesPage (§2)   — wraps these in its own article shell (identity row,
//                          跳到原訊息, 已等你 {t}).
//   • ChatReplyCard (§3) — wraps the SAME bodies in the chat-thread card.
//
// Three bodies, one per card state:
//   ReplyCardWaitingBody  — the quick-reply chips (each tagged AI 建議 iff it
//                           carries its OWN aiPick) + the typed ReplyComposer.
//                           A MULTI card stages: ticking accumulates and ONE
//                           send button submits the ticked options AND the
//                           typed text as a single answer. A SINGLE card does
//                           NOT stage — one click on a chip IS the answer and
//                           sends immediately (owner, card rc-06bc715358c2),
//                           carrying whatever is already typed alongside it.
//                           Answering is the only POSITIVE way out
//                           (no close/skip control exists —
//                           spec; 標為過期 (owner/admin agent, and since T-1b88
//                           the card's own author) lives in the card
//                           HEAD, outside this shared interior).
//   ReplyCardAnsweredBody — the final answer tagged 你選的 (+ AI 建議 when any
//                           circled option carries aiPick), 查看當初選項 expand, and 重新決定
//                           at the expansion's bottom (options re-arm + the
//                           same composer; cancel keeps the original answer).
//   ReplyCardExpiredBody  — the terminal 已過期 state (T-1aa4): a grey static
//                           note + the original options as a static review; no
//                           pick, no composer, no 重新決定 — an expiry is not
//                           an answer and never reopens.
//
// Error surfacing stays with the CALLER: onAnswer/onReanswer rejecting keeps
// the composer content (ReplyComposer's contract) / the standing answer; the
// caller shows its own error notice.

// Inline task reply card (SPEC §3.2 內嵌等我回覆卡, M3). Locked here for
// T-cdf4: the reply_card SSE topic is NOT per-card — any card being
// opened/answered fans the same topic to EVERY mounted inline card. A card
// that is already ANSWERED is terminal (only a local 重新決定 changes it, and
// that refetches itself), so it must IGNORE the delta; a still-WAITING card
// must still refetch so it can flip in place. This is the fix for the
// broadcast-storm where 70+ historical cards each refetched on one unrelated
// answer.

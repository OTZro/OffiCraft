// T-d593 — every unread-badge render site must reach the ONE ring slot.
//
// WHY A SOURCE SCAN, and why in vitest rather than only CT:
//   * The claim "all SEVEN render sites are themed by one token" is a chain with
//     two links: 7 sites → 3 CSS classes, and 3 classes → the ring token. The
//     browser guard (visual-guards/badge-ring-token.ct.spec.tsx) proves the
//     SECOND link by measuring real painted colour. Nothing proved the FIRST —
//     `npm run lint:token-roles` checks the three SELECTORS, never which
//     elements wear them, so an eighth badge with its own class, or one site
//     quietly switched to another class, passes every existing gate.
//   * 🔴 And `npm run test:ct` does not run on EVERY cloud gate. Since T-0fef it
//     runs on the macOS runner (macos-host-gates → bin/ci-macos-host.sh block 4),
//     but bin/ci-cloud.sh (ubuntu) still runs vitest only. So a CT-only guard is
//     still invisible on that lane. This file is the half that runs everywhere.
//     ⚠️ The older wording here said test:ct was in NO cloud gate at all; that
//     stopped being true at T-0fef. The reason this file exists did not change —
//     only the size of the gap it covers.
//
// Same shape as styleOwnership.test.ts: read the shipped source, assert a
// structural invariant no runtime test can see.

// hooks/sharedServerSettings.ts — the ONE /api/settings read a cockpit load
// makes (T-8115). See lib/sharedSnapshot.ts for the merge / cache / generation
// / invalidation contract; this file is only the wiring.
//
// Every mount-fetch consumer of the settings snapshot calls `loadServerSettings`
// instead of `api.getServerSettings` directly, and every successful PATCH hands
// its echoed effective values to `adoptServerSettings` — that echo is what
// keeps this tab's copy true (it is also the ONLY thing that does: the server
// pushes no settings delta, so another tab's save is invisible here until a
// reload, a known and accepted boundary).
//
// Two callers deliberately do NOT read from the cache and use
// `refreshServerSettings`:
//   - the onboarding poll, which exists to WATCH a value change (a cached
//     answer would make it poll its own memory forever);
//   - 設定's 存檔測連通 read-back, whose entire job is to prove the server
//     agrees with what was just written.

// lib/diffLink.ts — the compare screen's ADDRESS.
//
// T-59 (owner 2026-09-03): a comparison is no longer an attachment somebody
// clicks, it is a URL. Two flavours of the SAME url:
//
//   internal  /diff?before=…&after=…            — no signature, needs a session
//   external  /diff?before=…&after=…&sig=…      — the server-minted signature
//                                                 opens it with no login at all
//
// No expiry, same as the file-level share link (lib/shareLink.ts) it is modelled
// on. This module is the single parse/format seam for that url — the twin of
// lib/hashRoute.ts, which owns the STUDIO's own navigational state. They are two
// different address spaces on purpose: everything in the hash is a view of the
// office the reader is logged into, while this one has to survive being pasted
// into Slack and opened by someone who is not.
//
// A SIDE is one of exactly two shapes, and the grammar is the server's:
//
//   att-<12 lowercase hex>            a stored blob
//   doc:<kind>/<key>/<at>/<field>     one field of one document at one point in
//                                     time — `at` is "current", "seed", or a
//                                     retained revision's id in decimal
//
// ⚠️ WHAT THIS MODULE DOES *NOT* DO: resolve a side. The two texts and the two
// column headings come from GET /api/diff (api/diff.ts) in one response — the
// server reads the blob or the revision and says which side is gone. Parsing
// here is only ever used to answer "is this string an address at all", so a
// malformed link fails on the reader's own screen instead of being forwarded to
// the server as a question about nothing.

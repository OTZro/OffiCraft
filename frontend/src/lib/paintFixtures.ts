// paintFixtures.ts — T-1500. The ONE source of truth for the paint-cache guard
// fixtures, shared by BOTH layers that guard the pre-React applier:
//
//   * src/lib/themePaint.test.ts        (jsdom, gate 4b) — asserts the VALIDATOR
//     rejects every malicious record and ACCEPTS + APPLIES the valid rich one.
//   * paint-guards/*.paint.spec.ts      (real Chromium on the real build, gate
//     4c) — asserts no frame of a real page load ever carries a rejected value,
//     and that the valid rich record's values DO land.
//
// Two layers, one fixture list: a payload added here is guarded in both, and the
// two can never silently disagree about what "malicious" means.
//
// NOTE ON THE POSITIVE CASE (`VALID_RICH_BUNDLE`): it deliberately carries
// colours AND fonts AND a canvas background AND a background mode. An
// absence-only suite (only "this forbidden string never appears") stays green
// when the applier silently STOPS applying fonts/backgrounds altogether — that
// exact mutant (delete the fonts loop + the canvas branch from applyThemeToRoot)
// passed tsc, the build, the artifact assertions, the 11 decision tests and a
// 6-case absence-only browser probe. `EXPECT_APPLIED` is what closes it.

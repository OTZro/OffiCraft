// themePaint.test.ts — T-1500 gate 4b (jsdom). The VALIDATION half of the
// pre-React paint guard, and the half that does not need a browser.
//
// Why this file exists at all: the pre-React inline script's only protection
// against an attacker-writable localStorage record reaching
// element.style.setProperty is that it calls readValidatedPaint(). With that
// protection removed the CSS injection hole is wide open — and BOTH ways of
// removing it kept tsc green, so a reviewer reading types alone sees nothing.
//
// 🔴 THE TWO WAYS ARE CAUGHT BY DIFFERENT FILES. An independent review measured
// this, and the earlier version of this comment had it backwards — it claimed
// the assertions below go red for the inline-bypass mutant. They do not:
//
//   M1  gut readValidatedPaint ITSELF (bare JSON.parse in this module)
//       → THIS file goes red (6) + paintCache.test.tsx goes red (4).
//   M2  leave the validator intact, have the INLINE SCRIPT bypass it
//       (prePaint.ts reads localStorage and JSON.parses it directly)
//       → this file 19/19 GREEN, all three jsdom files 40/40 GREEN, tsc clean.
//       Only paint-guards/payloadInjection.paint.spec.ts goes red (5 of 6
//       payloads; the sixth is CSSOM-stopped and declares itself uncovered).
//
// Getting this backwards is not a cosmetic slip: it reads as "the jsdom layer
// already covers the inline bypass", which is exactly the argument someone
// reaches for when they want to drop the browser gate for cost. It does not.
// The two layers are complements, and neither replaces the other.

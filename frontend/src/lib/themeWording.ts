 * absent overlay is admissible). Every rule but one is strict; an unknown
 * message code is dropped from `wording` IN PLACE (T-081b) so the overlay that
 * reaches the caller — and the store — holds only live codes.
 *
 * `skipped` is an OUT-parameter warning channel: every dropped code is appended
 * to it (once, even when several languages override the same code) so the
 * import UI can name what it silently threw away. It is deliberately separate

// T-d593 — the unread badge's 1px ring must be a THEMEABLE slot.
//
// owner 2026-08-01 (rc-1d57d0adc87d 選②), verbatim: 「外框完全自由,不留下限
// (主題調到看不見也算你的選擇)」. Before this ticket the ring was
// `outline: 1px solid var(--color-bg)` at all three rules — a theme could only
// move it by moving the whole page background.
//
// WHY THIS IS A CT GUARD AND NOT jsdom: jsdom does not compute CSS. It resolves
// no `var()`, loads no stylesheet, and `getComputedStyle(el).outlineColor` there
// answers about a browser default that never ships. Every assertion below reads
// the colour the browser ACTUALLY painted, which is the only form of this claim
// worth pinning. The companion source scan (src/components/badgeRing.test.ts)
// covers what jsdom CAN answer, and — importantly — runs in the cloud gate,
// which `npm run test:ct` does not (bin/ci-cloud.sh runs vitest only).
//
// 🔴 DISCRIMINATING POWER, stated honestly per assertion, because two of the
// three would have passed BEFORE this change and must not be miscounted as
// evidence for it:
//   * "default matches --color-bg"      → ZERO power for this diff (the old CSS
//     hardcoded exactly that). It is here for a DIFFERENT invariant: existing
//     themes must look unchanged. Keep it, don't credit it.
//   * "ring follows --color-bg when the ring slot is unset" → also zero power
//     for the diff; it pins the ALIAS default specifically (a solid #191c24
//     default would fail it, and that mutant is real — it would silently break
//     every theme that repaints --color-bg).
//   * "setting --color-danger-badge-ring repaints all three" → THE ONE that
//     fails on the pre-change tree. Mutant run recorded in the ticket: reverting
//     the three CSS rules to var(--color-bg) turns exactly this test red.

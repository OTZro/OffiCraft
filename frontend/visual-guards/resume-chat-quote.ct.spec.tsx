// LAYOUT GUARD — the quote strip on the wake snapshot's chat rows (T-9871).
//
// ── WHY A REAL BROWSER ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Everything this file asserts is geometry, and jsdom has none: no flex, no
// wrapping, no container queries, every box all-zeroes. The unit suite can
// prove the quote's TEXT is on screen and is structurally unable to notice that
// it is 200px wider than the card it sits in.
//
// ── THE TRAP THIS EXISTS FOR ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The chat pane's quote row survives a narrow pane by DROPPING its jump label,
// and that rule lives inside `@container chat-pane (max-width: 520px)`. This
// card is rendered by the member / worker DETAIL PANEL, which is not inside
// that container — so the rule can never match here, and anything copied from
// the chat pane that relies on it is silently unprotected in the surface that
// is NARROWER than the one it was designed for. Nothing goes red; the strip
// just runs past the card's edge. So this row was given no such control, and
// its own answers (wrap the parties, break the excerpt, stretch to the card)
// are measured here at both ends of the width range.
//
// ── ORDERING ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The per-surface assertions come BEFORE the page-level scroll one on purpose:
// a page-level failure aborts the test, and an aborted test never runs the
// assertions under it — reading "it failed" as "the ones below were checked" is
// how a mutant gets credited to the wrong line.
//
// ── MUTANTS (each verified to redden ITS OWN assertion, in this order) ───────
//   drop `overflow-wrap: anywhere` from `.mp-resume__chatquotebody`
//        → ③ 「the excerpt is not breaking」, +105px at 320px, 1280 green.
//   `white-space: nowrap` on `.mp-resume__chatquoteparties`
//        → ② 「the quoted parties line does not fit its own box」, +27px at 320px.
//        (② is measured BEFORE ③ for this reason: ③ contains it and would
//        otherwise swallow the attribution.)
//   move the quote JSX below the message body
//        → ④ 「the quote must sit above the message body」, at BOTH widths.
//
//   SILENT, and recorded rather than papered over: `flex-wrap: nowrap` on the
//   parties line, and deleting `align-self: stretch` from the strip. Neither
//   moves anything — the party spans shrink and their text wraps on its own,
//   and a breakable excerpt's min-content is one character. So this file does
//   NOT hold those two declarations; the CSS says so beside them.

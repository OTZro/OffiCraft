// CT story: the wake snapshot's chat rows WITH the quote a reply carries
// (T-9871), in their real production DOM.
//
// It mounts the REAL <ChatRow> inside the REAL section skeleton, for the same
// reason ResumeChatRowStory does: a hand-copied skeleton keeps passing while
// the shipped stylesheet drifts, which is the regression a layout guard exists
// to catch.
//
// It is a SECOND story rather than three more rows on the first one because the
// existing guard counts the rows it measures (`toHaveCount(3)`), and growing
// that fixture would rewrite assertions that have nothing to do with quotes.
//
// The fixture is built to exercise the two ways this row can break a side panel
// that is NARROWER than the chat pane the quote line was designed in:
//   - PARTY NAMES LONG ENOUGH TO NOT FIT on one line at the narrow end. The
//     chat pane answers this by dropping its jump label under
//     `@container chat-pane`; this card is not inside that container, so that
//     rule can never fire here and the line has to wrap on its own.
//   - AN EXCERPT WITH NO BREAK OPPORTUNITY — 60 runes of unbroken latin, the
//     server's own cap. A quote that cannot shrink widens the whole card.

// CT story (T-4974): an expanded TaskCard whose free-text surfaces each carry
// an unbreakable long token — the exact shape the owner's iPhone screenshot
// circled inside a task card's baton text:
//   `twin(desired_state/desired_machine_id/refocus_since/bank_balance/...)`.
//
// The three owner/agent free-text renders on a card all go through `.doc-md`:
//   • description        → `.task-card__desc.doc-md`      (expanded-only)
//   • step DoD           → `.task-step__dod .doc-md`      (expanded-only)
//   • waiting reason     → `.task-step__waiting-md.doc-md`(a flex row item)
// (T-c514: the waiting reason used to render at the TASK level too; that
// duplicate block was removed, so the step's row is the surface under test.
// The first step is waiting_external here so that row actually renders.)
// None of them declared overflow-wrap before T-4974, so a no-whitespace token
// set the card's min-content to the token's full width, pushed the card past a
// 390px viewport and the whole PAGE scrolled sideways. Real TaskCard + real
// tasks.css so the guard measures production layout (jsdom is blind to it).

// T-c21e: the dep row now LEADS with the dep task's 狀態 badge, so that row got
// one nowrap pill wider on a card that 1ea673e had just finished stopping from
// bursting its container at 390px. The row is flex-nowrap and only
// `.task-card__dep-title` may shrink (min-width: 0) — so badge + ⏱ + 「等 <編號>」
// + ↗ form a hard floor, and this fixture is what proves that floor still fits
// a phone.
//
// T-5291 WIDENED THAT FLOOR, and this fixture had to follow. The number used to
// be a four-hex short code ("T-fbcf"); it is now the whole task id
// ("t-fbcf5291a019"), ~56px wider at this font size. While the fixtures still
// carried four-hex numbers, the guard was measuring a dep row NARROWER than the
// one production renders — i.e. it kept claiming to prove a floor it was no
// longer measuring. The ids below are therefore full-length and `taskNo === id`
// exactly as the server now sends it (domain.go TaskNo). 等我回覆 is TIED for the widest of the seven status labels (measured
// 42.3px, level with 尚未執行 and 等待外部 — an earlier version of this comment
// called it "the widest", which was a superlative nobody had measured; any of
// the three stresses the floor equally). The title carries the unbreakable
// token so the shrinking half is stressed at the same time.
